# Ignorance-is-Blissful
Ignorance is Blissful is a project that simulates a horror game. It's completely text based.
It has an inventory, a battle mechanic, and a story mechanic. 
You will make multiple decisions throughout the project that will let you navigate through the story. 
The features that are in my project:
Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application.
Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event).
