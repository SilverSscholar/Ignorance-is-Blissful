Your mother gives you a pitying look.
"It'll be okay honey," she assures you. 

"We just have to stop at the market and then we'll go home I promise, and you can sleep in your bed."

You nod tiredly, there wasn't much more you could do.

The rain is coming down harder now as you arrive off the interstate. The KREUGER lights welcoming you to your exit.
The lot was mostly empty, and why wouldn't it be it was practically midnight. You think.

You sleepily take off your seatbelt buckle, and your mom opens the door for you. Damn child-locks.
Your Pukicho footies were immediately drenched in the waters of the lot. Neither one of you had an umbrella.

Making a mad dash for the entrance of the store.
Both of you managed to get inside with about 5% of your outfits, not drenched.

It felt, a litte strange once you got inside however.
The register's were empty, and not many people seemed to be walking around in the store.

You voiced your concern about this to your mother. She just gave you a sweet smile.
"Well it's late baby, most people are in there bed's right now."

You asked her how you would both buy groceries without the register people. 

She smiled "There's self-scans."

You told her how dad said that self-scans are evil.
She scoffed, and rolled her eyes.

"Besides that, let's just get our groceries...I have a very important job for you."
